In this article we assess the potential distribution, tolerance limits and similarity niche of macroalgae epiphytes and hosts from the Cuba marine shelf. Using different methods (BIOCLIM, Gower, Maxent and SVM) we have modelled the niche for each species. The final prediction map of distribution was made using the ensemble prediction technique. The similarity of ENMs was quantified by Schoener'D and Hellinger'I distance. The predictive power of all models was reasonable, since the values of the area under the curve (AUC) were greater than 0.9. The host macroalgae most closely related to the spatial distribution pattern of potential abundance of epiphytic macroalgae are *Stypopodium zonale* (Kendall correlation, r 2 = 0.886) and *Digenea simplex* (Kendall correlation, r 2 = 0.777). Environmental variables that contributed mostly (30 %) to the ecological niche models were: the average maximum salinity per year (35.5− 36 PSU); the average minimum flow velocity per year (0.2 m⋅s − 1 ) and the average minimum light at ground level per year (10− 60 E⋅m − 2 ⋅yr − 1 ). The results show that epiphytic macroalgae and their most common hosts are generalist species (niche width 0.8) with high overlap in their niche (Schoener' D  0.7; Hellinger' I distance = I  0.6).","tags":null,"title":"Distribution of macroalgal epiphytes and host species from the Cuban marine shelf inferred from ecological modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Cartography has several applications in other areas of knowledge that need to perform the visualization of geospatial data.

Ecological and morphological similarities between  the invasive Australian palm, *Archontophoenix cunninghamiana,* and the native palm from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, *Euterpe edulis*, suggest that they have similar environmental requirements and  functional roles (i.e., the function a species performs in an  ecosystem). This similarity raises concerns about how the invasive palm  could impact the native species in the present and future. We used  spatial (species occurrences) and ecological information (frugivory  events) to characterize the environmental niche and functional role of  the two palms and assess their overlap. In addition, we predicted the  potential area of occurrence of each palm within the Brazilian Atlantic  Forest under current and future climate conditions.We estimated the  environmental conditions used by the invasive plant based on its native  distribution only, and based on all areas where the species is able to  establish across the globe. We found that the environmental niches of  the two palm species overlap up to 39%, which corresponds to 50% of the  current geographic distribution of E. edulis in the Atlantic Forest. In  the areas where the two species potentially co-occur, the impact of the  invasive species on the native should be influenced by the invasive  species interactions with frugivores. We found that the frugivory  functional role of the two palms was similar (84% overlap) which suggest that *A. cunninghamiana* might disrupt the seed dispersal of the  native palm. However, co-occurrence between the palms may decline with  future climate change, as the potentially environmental suitable area  for the invasive palm is predicted to decline by 10% to 55%. Evaluating  the similarity in both the environmental niche, of the native and global extent, and the functional role of native and invasive plants provides a detailed understanding of the potential impact of invasive species on  native species now and in the future.","tags":null,"title":"Environmental niche and functional role similarity between invasive and native palms in the Atlantic Forest","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Reginaldo A.

In this study, we diverge from traditional macroecological approaches by considering both biotic (avian species diversity) and abiotic (climatic) factors in determining the global distribution pattern of feather mite species richness, one of the most abundant and diverse bird ectosymbionts.. **Location**: Global. **Methods**: We used a global dataset of feather mite–bird interactions published in 2016, complemented with an up‐to‐date literature survey. We created statistical models designed to explain the effect of abiotic (i.e., temperature, precipitation and energy‐related variables) and biotic factors (bird species richness) on the species richness of feather mites. We used these models to predict global distribution patterns of mites and estimate each explanatory variable's relative importance in temperate and tropical regions. **Results**: According to our models, bird species richness accounts for ~63% of the global distribution pattern of mites, which is ten times more relevant than climatic variables. Among abiotic drivers, precipitation intensity and seasonality were the most important variables, accounting for 10% of mite species richness. This figure is lower in tropical regions, where biotic factors are seven times more important than in temperate regions. **Main conclusions**: We demonstrate that global mite diversity was primarily determined by biotic and, to a lesser extent, abiotic factors. The relative importance of the predictive variables, however, varied between tropical and temperate regions. The strong association between bird species richness and feather mite species diversity at a global scale raises concerns about the potential for future co‐extinctions.","tags":null,"title":"Host diversity outperforms climate as a global driver of symbiont diversity in the bird‐feather mite system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natalia Stefanini Da Silveira","Maurício Humberto Vancine","Alex E.

Addressing the effects of such changes on the migration of birds in South America is particularly challenging because the details about how birds migrate within the Neotropics are generally not well understood. Here, we aim to infer the potential effects of future climate change on breeding and wintering areas of birds that migrate within South America by estimating the size and elevations of their future breeding and wintering areas. We used occurrence data from species distribution databases (VertNet and GBIF), published studies, and eBird for 3 thrush species (Turdidae; *Turdus nigriceps*, *T. subalaris*, and *T. flavipes*) that breed and winter in different regions of South America and built ecological niche models using ensemble forecasting approaches to infer current and future potential distributions throughout the breeding and wintering periods of each species. Our findings point to future shifts in wintering and breeding areas, mainly through elevational and longitudinal changes. Future breeding areas for *T. nigriceps*, which migrates along the Andes Mountains, will be displaced to the west, while breeding displacements to the east are expected for the other 2 species. An overall loss in the size of future wintering areas was also supported for 2 of the species, especially for *T. subalaris*, but an increase is anticipated for *T. flavipes*. Our results suggest that future climate change in South America will require that species shift their breeding and wintering areas to higher elevations in addition to changes in their latitudes and longitude. Our findings are the first to show how future climate change may affect migratory birds in South America throughout the year and suggest that even closely related migratory birds in South America will be affected in different ways, depending on the regions where they breed and overwinter.","tags":null,"title":"Future climate change will impact the size and location of breeding and wintering areas of migratory thrushes in South America","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We R Live I and Felipe Sodré, through the GeoCast Brasil channel on YouTube, created this project to share a little bit of our knowledge about handling and visualizing geospatial data through the R language.

Our dataset comprises 7,062 records of 279 species, distributed across 122 local communities. We built richness maps based on climate and landscape models and analysed them separately to understand their contribution to the pattern of richness distribution. Then, we combined both models to build a consensus map. Finally, we designed specific conservation strategies based on richness categories distributed on the consensus map. **Results**: The regions with high-predicted species richness for both climate and landscape models supported the main endemism locations described for other AF taxa in previous studies. Both models predicted intermediate values of species richness for most regions, but the patterns of richness distribution were not fully congruent. High species richness based on landscape metrics was frequently concentrated in the south. Furthermore, locations suitable for high species richness according to climate are near to the endemism centres, ut also to dense urban centres, highlighting the potential impacts of the landscape modification on butterfly species richness. **Main conclusions**: The distribution of fruit-feeding butterfly species richness and endemism reflect the classic division of AF in different sub-regions according to the endemism centres proposed by previous authors for other taxa. The availability of forested habitats seems to be a determining factor for the maintenance of high species richness in AF. Therefore, the loss of natural forest remnants due to landscape modification is the primary threat to butterfly diversity.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of landscape modification on species richness patterns of fruit-feeding butterflies in Brazilian Atlantic Forest","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emma-Liina Marjakangas","Nerea Abrego","Vidar Grøtan","Renato A.

In particular, tropical forest regeneration depends on due to forest fragmentation and defaunation. Here, we assess how fragmentation influences the pairwise interactions between 407 seed disperser and 1,424 tree species in a highly fragmented biodiversity hotspot. **Location**: Atlantic Forest, South America. **Methods**: We predicted interaction networks in 912 sites covering the entire biome by combining verified interaction data with co-occurrence probabilities obtained from a spatially explicit joint species distribution model. We identified keystone seed dispersers by computing a species-specific keystone index and by selecting those species belonging to the top 5% quantile. **Results**: We show that forest fragmentation affects seed dispersal interactions negatively, and the decreased area of functionally connected forest, rather than increased edge effects, is the main driver behind the loss of interactions. Both the seed disperser availability for the local tree communities and in particular the proportion of interactions provided by keystone seed dispersers decline with increasing degree of fragmentation. Importantly, just 21 keystone species provided 40% of all interactions. The numbers of interactions provided by keystone and non-keystone species, however, were equally negatively affected by fragmentation, suggesting that seed dispersal interactions may not be rewired under strong fragmentation effects. **Conclusions**: We highlight the importance of understanding the fragmentation-induced compositional shifts in seed disperser communities as they may lead to lagged and multiplicative effects on tree communities. Our results illustrate the utility of model-based prediction of interaction networks as well as model-based identification of keystone species as a tool for prioritizing conservation efforts. Similar modelling approaches could be applied to other threatened ecosystems and interaction types globally.","tags":null,"title":"Fragmented tropical forests lose mutualistic plant-animal interactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   In this video, at the invitation of Felipe Sodré, from the channel GeoCast Brasil, I did a rather long live , where I talked about Landscape Ecology and some of the main concepts linked to this discipline, and a practical part about the calculation of landscape metrics using the R language, more specifically using the [landscapemetrics](https: // r- spatialecology.github.io/landscapemetrics/) package.

Invasive marmosets can hybridize with native congeners reducing the genetic integrity on native populations. However, no study quantified the spatial extent of these invasions and which species can be impacted by a hybridization process. Here, we predicted the range expansion and hence the potential geographic overlap between *Callithrix* species, particularly in Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, to discuss management strategies. We hypothesized that marmosets endemic to the Atlantic Forest are more threatened by invasive congeners than other marmosets. We generated species distribution models for six *Callithrix* species using four algorithms, six environmental layers and 445 georeferenced localities extracted from literature published since 2000. Suitability maps for each species were binarized using a 20-percentile threshold and overlapped to predict invasion and quantify hybridization potential risks. All *Callithrix* species had potential to expand their range within the Atlantic Forest although suitable habitats for *C. flaviceps* and *C. kuhlii* were more limited. *C. jacchus* and *C. penicillata* have already expanded their range to different biomes and our model shows that they can spread even further. The potential hybridization zones were identified within the distribution range of all species, and more markedly within Atlantic Forest species ranges. For assuring the ecosystem equilibriums, we urge to prevent the biological in vasions and to control the human-induced *Callithrix* introductions and expansions within Neotropical hotspots.","tags":null,"title":"Predicting the potential hybridization zones between native and invasive marmosets within Neotropical biodiversity hotspots","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["short course"],"content":"  The wide availability of data on biodiversity and environmental variables, has allowed the use of several biogeographic and macroecological analyzes, among them, the species distribution models (MDE).

Initially, an introduction to the programming and handling of spatial data in the R language will be made, using the raster and rgdal packages. Then, it will be presented how to obtain data of occurrences and environmental variables, through spocc and dismo packages. Once the data is acquired, preliminary analyzes will be made, such as selection of occurrences (one point per cell) and variables (correlation, PCA, factor analysis and VIF).

Understanding the influence of land-use changes on suitable habitats for species is a worldwide conservation challenge, particularly on large-sized mammals. We modeled habitat suitability of the threatened giant anteater (*Myrmecophaga tridactyla*) in the Brazilian State of São Paulo. The region is the most populous and economically developed of the country and is the world’s main sugarcane production area. We aimed to 1) map habitat suitability for the giant anteater population in the State; 2) assess the contributions of selected landscape and anthropogenic predictors to species habitat suitability; and 3) quantify suitable habitats in environmental protection areas and in areas threatened by the sugarcane expansion. We used a two-step analysis: First, we created a suitability map in the species’ distributional range (Drange); from this map, we extracted the results for São Paulo State. Second, we built a regional model to predict the current scenario of São Paulo using the following environmental layers: 1) the resulting distributional range map for giant anteater (Drange); 2) landscape metrics; and 3) anthropogenic factors that might affect anteaters. The State of São Paulo presented, in general, very low values of habitat suitability. The following predictors made the greatest contribution: Drange, vegetation connectivity and distance to protected areas. Suitable habitats for anteaters within strictly protected areas are very scarce (1.6% of the total area), and 22% of the suitable areas are expected to be altered by future sugarcane expansion. Suitable habitats on private lands must play a role in conserving biodiversity.","tags":null,"title":"Land-use changes and the expansion of biofuel crops threaten the giant anteater in southeastern Brazil","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andréia Mantovani Ferro e Silva","Thadeu Sobral-Souza","Maurício Humberto Vancine","Renata Lara Muylaert","Ana Paula de Abreu","Sandra Marisa Pelloso","Maria Dalva de Barros Carvalho","Luciano de Andrade","Milton Cezar Ribeiro","Max Jean de Ornelas Toledo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1540512000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540512000,"objectID":"936ee382d33edec2c4a7d8df18606366","permalink":"https://mauriciovancine.github.io/publication/2018-ferro-e-silva-etal/","publishdate":"2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-ferro-e-silva-etal/","section":"publication","summary":"After obtaining certification of the absence of transmission of the *Trypanosoma cruzi* by Triatoma infestans in 2006, other native species of protozoan vectors have been found in human dwellings within municipalities of the State of Paraná, Southern Brazil. However, the spatial distribution of *T. cruzi* vectors and how climatic and landscape combined variables explain the distribution are still poorly understood. The goal of this study was to predict the potential distribution of *T. cruzi* vectors as a proxy for Chagas disease transmission risk using Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) based on climatic and landscape variables. We hypothesize that ENM based on both climate and landscape variables are more powerful than climate-only or landscape-only models, and that this will be true independent of vector species. A total of 2,662 records of triatomines of five species were obtained by community-based entomological surveillance from 2007 to 2013. The species with the highest number of specimens was *Panstrongylus megistus* (73%; n = 1,943), followed by *Panstrongylus geniculatus* (15.4%; 411), *Rhodnius neglectus* (6.0%; 159), *Triatoma sordida* (4.5%; 119) and *Rhodnius prolixus* (1.1%; 30). Of the total, 71.9% were captured at the intradomicile. *T. cruzi* infection was observed in 19.7% of the 2,472 examined insects. ENMs were generated based on selected climate and landscape variables with 1 km 2 spatial resolution. Zonal statistics were used for classifying the municipalities as to the risk of occurrence of synanthropic triatomines. The integrated analysis of the climate and landscape suitability on triatomines geographical distribution was powerful on generating good predictive models. Moreover, this showed that some municipalities in the northwest, north and northeast of the Paraná state have a higher risk of *T. cruzi* vector transmission. This occurs because those regions present high climatic and landscape suitability values for occurrence of their vectors. The frequent invasion of houses by infected triatomines clearly indicates a greater risk of transmission of *T. cruzi* to the inhabitants. More public health attention should be given in the northern areas of the State of Paraná, which presents high climate and landscape suitabilities for the disease vectors. In conclusion, our results–through spatial analysis and predictive maps–showed to be effective in identifying areas of potential distribution and, consequently, in the definition of strategic areas and actions to prevent new cases of Chagas’ disease, reinforcing the need for continuous and robust surveillance in these areas.","tags":null,"title":"Spatial prediction of risk areas for vector transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi in the State of Paraná, southern Brazil","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["talk"],"content":"  Uncertainties about the diversity and distribution of species is one of the main challenges for conservation biology. The Atlantic Forest Biome is considered one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots in the world, still holding a high number of amphibian species. In this work, we present a detailed compilation of amphibian communities for the Atlantic Forest. The data set was organized based on a wide geographical delimitation of the biome, encompassing ecotones and areas of Paraguay and Argentina. All community information was obtained from articles, books and unpublished literature (graduation monographs, dissertations and theses). We organize information about: 1) sampled habitat, 2) sampling methods, 3) sampling schedule, 4) sampling effort (initial and final month and year), 5) species composition or abundance, 6) endemism, and 7) location geographic (latitude, longitude, country, state, municipality and specific location). We made taxonomic updates based on data from the Amphibian Species of the World: an Online Reference database, for September 2017. The database was structured from 389 references, sampled between 1940 and 2017, which included 1,163 study, for which there are 17,619 records of 528 species with taxonomic certainty. Of the total records, 14,450 (82%) were classified according to the criterion of endemism to the Atlantic Forest Biome, of which 7,787 (44%) were considered endemic. The most representative methods were: 1) visual or auditory search (82.1%), 2) reproductive site search (20%), 3) trap and fall trap (pitfall, 15.3%), and 4) encounter occasional (14.5%). Among the sampled habitats, none was predominant, although the forest habitat was reported more frequently (40.7%). Most of the study sites had sampling carried out in bodies of water: stream within the forest (33.5%), permanent puddle (30.2%), lake (28.9%), marsh (28.6%) %), temporary pool (27.5%), semi-permanent pool (5.8%) and open water stream (4.5%). Species richness was 15.2 ± 11.3 SD, ranging from 1 to 80 species per location. There was a large sampling bias, with the majority of sampling carried out in the states of São Paulo (38.4%), Paraná (14.2%) and Minas Gerais (10.1%), collectively representing almost 63% of researches. This high bias for these three states may have been due to several reasons: 1) description of two or more study sites for the same reference; 2) historical process of training researchers, in addition to encouraging amphibian sampling research by the BIOTA-FAPESP Program; and 3) numerous herpetological collections, which possibly attracted researchers to carry out taxonomic works. The result of this data compilation generated an overview of the diversity, composition, methods and sampling effort of amphibian communities for the Atlantic Forest Biome, representing a huge effort to fill a knowledge gap about amphibian biodiversity in the Neotropical Region. We hope that these data can be used as a tool for the conservation of this group, in addition to being an important data source for studies of macroecological and biogeographic patterns.\n ","date":1533400200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532908800,"objectID":"7ebc4afc509511f1faadc7880be059c6","permalink":"https://mauriciovancine.github.io/talk/talk-data-paper-amphibians-anfoco/","publishdate":"2020-03-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/talk-data-paper-amphibians-anfoco/","section":"talk","summary":"Amphibian community database for the Atlantic Forest in ANFoCO","tags":["dataset","amphibians","community ecology"],"title":"ATLANTIC AMPHIBIANS: Atlantic Forest Amphibian Communities Dataset","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Maurício Humberto Vancine","Kauã da Silva Duarte","Yuri Silva de Souza","João Gabriel Ribeiro Giovanelli","Paulo Mateus Martins‐Sobrinho","Ariel López","Rafael Parelli Bovo","Fábio Maffei","Marília Bruzzi Lion","José Wagner Ribeiro Júnior","Ricardo Brassaloti","Carolina Ortiz Rocha da Costa","Henrique Oliveira Sawakuchi","Lucas Rodriguez Forti","Pier Cacciali","Jaime Bertoluci","Célio Fernando Baptista Haddad","Milton Cezar Ribeiro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"559f02ceb228cee7189ac5a6fbf93ac5","permalink":"https://mauriciovancine.github.io/publication/2018-vancine-etal/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-vancine-etal/","section":"publication","summary":"Amphibians are among the most threatened vertebrates in the world and this is also true for those inhabiting the Atlantic Forest hotspot, living in ecosystems that are highly degraded and threatened by anthropogenic activities.

Human and climate change impacts are the principal drivers of species loss in both biomes, more severely in the Atlantic Forest. In response to species loss, the main conservation action is the creation of protected areas (PAs). Current knowledge and research on the PA network's conservation efficiency is scarce, and existing studies have mainly considered a past temporal view. In this study, we tested the efficiency of the current PA network to maintain climatically stable areas (CSAs) across the Amazon and Atlantic Forest. To this, we used an ecological niche modeling approach to biome and paleoclimatic simulations. We propose three categories of conservation priority areas for both biomes, considering CSAs, PAs and intact forest remnants. The biomes vary in their respective PA networks' protection efficiency. Regarding protect CSAs, the Amazon PA network is four times more efficient than the Atlantic Forest PA network. New conservation efforts in these two forest biomes require different approaches.

We investigated how landscape structure—percent forest cover, patch density, percent cover by edge, perimeter-area ratio, and spatial heterogeneity—affects the diversity of mammalian carnivores at multiple extents within 22 Atlantic Forest landscapes. We hypothesized that 1) species richness of carnivores is positively related to forest cover; and 2) the occurrence of species will vary according to its sensitivity to forest loss and its preference for forest or open areas. Species richness, composition, and occurrence of mammalian carnivores were correlated with several landscape structure metrics. Due to a high correlation among the metrics, we adopted forest cover as the principal predictor variable. We compared a forest cover model to a null model using Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), and evaluated other fragmentation metrics using a redundancy analysis. Carnivore species richness was positively related to forest cover and negatively associated with other fragmentation metrics. However, the responses to landscape structure differed among species, possibly due to their differences in habitat use. Landscape configuration is an important factor influencing carnivore species composition. Forest cover can explain some, but not all, carnivore species occurrence.

The Atlantic Forest is one of the most fragmented South American biodiversity hotspots and retains about 12% of its original vegetation cover. Most of these remnants are distributed in small isolated fragments immersed mainly within pastures and sugarcane monocultures. Here we examine how species richness and composition of medium and large-sized mammals are explained by forest cover, structural area and forest edge amount at the landscape scale. We sampled 22 fragmented landscapes dominated by sugarcane plantations along a wide gradient of forest cover (3% to 96%) in southeastern Brazil. We recorded 88% of terrestrial mammal species expected for this region, but many likely local extirpations were detected at the landscape scale, with losses between 50% to 80% of species. Most of the landscapes were highly depleted of forest-specialist species, with replacements by exotics and/or species typical of non-forest habitats. We found that total mammalian species richness, which includes forest-specialists, generalists, exotics and non-forest dwelling species, was not affected by landscape metrics, such as forest cover, structural area and forest edge amount. Nevertheless, forest cover was important predictor of the presence of three ungulates, a medium-sized rodent, and an armadillo. Local mammalian communities exhibited a high degree of species turnover between landscapes, representing 95% of the total β-diversity. In this region, where there was no regional extinction, landholder compliance with the Brazilian Forest Bill and restoration measures will enhance habitat connectivity and mammal persistence across the wider unprotected countryside.","tags":null,"title":"High mammal species turnover in forest patches immersed in biofuel plantations","type":"publication"}]
