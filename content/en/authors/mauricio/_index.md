I am a Spatial Ecologist and Doctoral Student at the [Department of Biodiversity](https://ib.rc.unesp.br/#!/departamentos/ecologia/) of the [São Paulo State University](https://ib.rc.unesp.br/#!/), Rio Claro/SP, Brazil. I have experience in landscape ecology, effects of habitat loss and fragmentation, amphibian ecology, species distribution modeling (SDM), analysis of ecological and spatial data.
