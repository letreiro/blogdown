The R language has stood out in recent years (since 2000), as the main tool for data management, visualization and analysis, mainly in the area of Ecology, Psychology, Economics, and more recently, in Data Science. In this course, four introductory themes of this language will be addressed: (i) introduction and operation of the R language and RStudio software, (ii) data structure and manipulation, (iii) introduction to tidyverse, and (iv) data visualization. The workload will be approximately 08 hours, where the theoretical-practical part will be focused, interspersed with exercises to fix the content. At the end of the course, participants are expected to have a general understanding of language functioning and potential applications within the area of ecological data analysis.
